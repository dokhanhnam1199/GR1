However, some banks, like ACB, experienced a slight decline in profit compared to the same period last year, which was attributed to unusual income in prior years.

Analysts cite factors like improved net interest margins (NIM), potential one-time gains, and favorable valuations as supporting the positive outlook.  While future profit projections are ambitious, the current market sentiment seems to favor VPBank.  High trading volume, exceeding 3-year highs, further reinforces investor confidence.

This growth is anticipated due to a combination of factors, including improving loan growth, the impact of interest rate adjustments, and a relatively low base for comparison from the previous year.  However, some banks (e.g., Techcombank, ACB, and VIB) are expected to see slower or even negative profit growth in Q3, primarily due to increased loan loss provisions.  Overall, the outlook suggests a positive, but varied, financial performance across the banking sector in Vietnam during Q3 2024, heavily influenced by the economic recovery and continued adjustments in lending and deposit rates.
